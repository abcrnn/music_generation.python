**Goal**: The goal of this app is to help artists to create new music on a specific genre.

### How
- In this work, Our experimentation is conducted using Python utilizing Keras and Tensorflow. The web app is built with tensorflowjs.

### What
- A music generator application aim to help musician gain inspiration on their music production.
