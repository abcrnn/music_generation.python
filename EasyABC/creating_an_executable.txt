This note describes how to create a Windows PC executable of easy_abc.

You can find a tutorial on the site http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial
which is somewhat accurate.

easy_abc comes with setup.py which is used to create easy_abc.exe.

You will also need to install on your computer, py2exe, cx_Freeze-*.win32.py2.7,
and mechanize. They are all found on http://sourceforge.net. Ensure that these
scripts go into the folder linked to PYTHONPATH.

Copy all the executables, abc2abc.exe, abc2midi.exe, abcm2ps.exe,
nwc2xml.exe, and zlibwapi.dll into the bin folder. You can find nwc2xml.exe
and zlibwapi.dll in the older easy_abc install.

Copy the folder Microsoft.VC90.CRT into your easyabc_source_code... folder.

Open a command window, CD to the folder easyabc_source_code... and set the
PYTHON and PYTHONPATH using the autoexec.bat file.  You should now be
ready.

python setup.py install

You should see lots of messages and an executable with other files
should be put into the folder build/exe.win32-27/ which you will find
in the easy_source_code... folder.

I found that executable runs fine on Windows 7 64-bit but,
I did not get it to run on my Windows XP laptop.

The package also comes with setup.iss which is a script for running
the Inno Setup Compiler which is freely available. The setup.iss
file should no longer be used since it assumes a build/exe.win32-26/
created by Python2.6 rather than Python2.7. Instead you should
use setupEasy07.iss which I created recently. You will also
require Inno Setup installed on your PC. See the header of text
file setupEasy07.iss.

I also created an install script for the "nullsoft scriptable install
system 2.46" (NSIS) before discovering Inno Setup. I have left the
script here easyabc.nsi but I now prefer Inno Setup which appears
to be the standard.
